## 📚 Industry-Standard Git Guide
  ⋙ I have created a professional documentation guide covering the advanced Git workflows used in top-tier tech companies.

**"This repository includes a comprehensive Technical Documentation PDF on Git and Version Control. Unlike basic tutorials, this guide is structured for industry-level standards, covering:
Branching Strategies: Implementation of Git Flow (Main, Develop, and Feature branches).
Security & Hygiene: Managing .gitignore and protecting sensitive environmental variables.
Conflict Resolution: Professional protocols for handling merge conflicts and repository recovery.
Corporate Best Practices: Atomic commits, conventional commit messaging, and pull request workflows."**
